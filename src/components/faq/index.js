    question: 'If Iâ€™m unable to purchase one of the NFTs upon public sale, how else can I become a member?',

    question: 'How much will the NFT cost?',

      'Initial price will be set at 1.28 ETH. Final price could be anywhere between 0.88 - 1.28 ETH plus gas fees.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Why Last Price Dutch Auction?',
    answer: [
      'Given our limited mint number and potential interest, we want to be cognizant of high gas fees. With Last Price Dutch Auction minting, the thought is that transactions are spread out over time as people observe pricing changes, helping reduce competitive gas prices. Unlike a normal dutch auction, purchasers do not pay a higher premium even if they mint at a higher price. The difference between the higher price paid and the last price are refunded, i.e. Minter pays 1.25 ETH but the final price is 1 ETH post minting. Minter who paid 1.25 ETH receives a 0.25 ETH refund.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'How long am I a member for?',
    answer: [
      'You are a member for as long as you hold the membership key. Membership will be transferred to the new owner of the NFT if sold (available to be exchanged via secondary market).',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I attend GoldenDAO events if I do not have an NFT membership key?',
    answer: [
      'Currently, all planned events in-person and virtually are exclusively held for GoldenDAO members and partners. We plan on expanding membership for our Season 2 NFT drop (see roadmap for details). Membership will continue to be available for individuals via the secondary market(i.e. OpenSea).',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'When do I receive the GoldenDAO member ring?',
    answer: [
      'You must be a member (have the NFT in your wallet) in the designated month that the signet rings are delivered.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there differences in membership benefits between presale, public sale, and reserve?',
    answer: ['No. All NFT holders will receive the same benefits, including the gifted physical custom signet ring.'],
  },
  {
    question: 'When can I mint the NFT?',
    answer: [
      'Our presale date will be announced during the week of 3/21/22 and our public sale date will be on 3/31/22. Stay tuned for announcements on Twitter and Discord for exact sale time windows.',
